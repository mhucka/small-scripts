## Introduction

This is a collection of short scripts, written in a variety of programming languages and for a variety of purposes.  You are welcome to copy and use them as you see fit.  If you discover problems or can think of improvements, please me know, either using GitHub's commenting system, or a pull request, or directly via email ([mhucka@caltech.edu](mhucka@caltech.edu)).  These scripts are distributed under a BSD open-source license.

The following is a listing of the categories of scripts contained here:

The following have been moved to separate repos:

* [`mac-scripts`](https://github.com/mhucka/mac-scripts) &ndash; scripts useful on Mac OS X systems

The following are obsolete because I don't use the software anymore, but kept here for historical reasons.  Some of these are ancient and haven't been tried for a decade or more:

## Authors and history

This is a small set of scripts out of many that I've written over the years.  At one point I thought I would systematically gather them into this repository, but never readlly did.  Now it's kind of a hodge-podge of random things.  I want to make it better, but it still hasn't happened.  (Sigh.)
