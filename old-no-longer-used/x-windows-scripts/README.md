Mike's old X Windows scripts
============================

I used this for a decade back when running X windows under BSD and SunOS Unixes, and later Linux flavors.  I haven't used these for years, and they may not run in current OSes or X environments.  They're also certainly very specific to my personal preferences.  Still, here they are, in case someone finds them useful, however unlikely that is....
